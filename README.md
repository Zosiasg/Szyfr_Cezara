## General Information
The program implements the so-called Caesar cipher operating on characters entered directly from the keyboard. 

## Technologies Used
Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022
Version 17.2.1
VisualStudio.17.Release/17.2.1+32516.85
Microsoft .NET Framework
Version 4.8.04161

Installed version: Community

C# tools  4.2.0-4.22252.24
C# components used in the IDE. Depending on the type of project and its settings, a different version of the compiler may be used.

## Features
There is one parameter: _przesuniecie_, number of characters by which entered letters should be shifted.
The program accepts only small letters from the English alphabet.

## Setup
The project requires Visual Studio with C# components to be installed on a local machine for compilation.

## Usage
Pressing the key corresponding to a letter causes the letter to appear shifted by a key specified by the user.
The letter q is not encoded - it terminates the program (quit function).

## Project Status
Project is: _no longer being worked on_. 

## Room for Improvement
One could consider adding support for capital letters and special characters.
